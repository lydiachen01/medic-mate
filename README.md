# Hack@Brown 2025 - MedicMate App
Project team: Yvette Roos, Helena Fu, Lydia Chen, Trishna Bahal
MedicMate is a personalized app designed to demystify and gamify medical treatment plans, ensuring patients stay informed, engaged, and in control of their health. Medical jargon can be overwhelming, treatments are complicated and emotionally draining, and mistakes happen—shaking trust in the healthcare system. MedicMate simplifies this by providing clear, concise explanations of prescribed therapies, medications, and scheduled appointments, all in one place.

How We Solve the Problem
- Aggregated Treatment Information: Patients can access an up-to-date, personalized overview of their treatment plan with easy-to-understand explanations and helpful reminders.
- Medication Interaction Checker: Cross-check medications for dangerous interactions and ensure safety with real-time updates from trusted sources like the FDA and NIH.
- Patient Empowerment: Give users more control over their treatment by allowing them understand complex treatment plans without the jargon.
- Computer Vision Verification: Using image classification (TensorFlow, OpenCV, HuggingFace), patients can scan their pills to confirm identity based on color, shape, imprints, and dosage.
- Warnings & Precautions: Receive automatic alerts about dietary restrictions, side effects, and activities to avoid based on verified medical sources.
- Multi-Language Support: Our custom-trained LLM provides accurate translations for medical terms, ensuring accessibility for diverse populations.
- Seamless Integration: Connect with patient portals for easy access to records, automated notifications, and an intuitive UI for tracking medications and conditions.

Features
✅ User-Friendly Web App: A simple, intuitive interface to manage medications and treatment plans.
✅ Pill Identification: High-resolution medication images and AI-based verification.
✅ Therapy & Dosage Tracking: Automated reminders via text notifications.
✅ Comprehensive Summary: An at-a-glance view of medications, allergies, and ongoing conditions.

## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This+starter+configures+Supabase+Auth+to+use+cookies%2C+making+the+user%27s+session+available+throughout+the+entire+Next.js+app+-+Client+Components%2C+Server+Components%2C+Route+Handlers%2C+Server+Actions+and+Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd with-supabase-app
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

6. This template comes with the default shadcn/ui style initialized. If you instead want other ui.shadcn styles, delete `components.json` and [re-install shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.
